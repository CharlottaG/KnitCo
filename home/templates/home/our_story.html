                Our Story <br> Woven with Tradition
            </h1>
            <p class="text text-white me-4">
                Welcome to Knit&Co, your premier online yarn shop dedicated to preserving the rich tradition of Nordic
                knitting. Our mission is to bring you the finest selection of natural fiber yarns, sourced exclusively
                from Nordic producers who share our passion for quality, sustainability, and ethical practices.</p>

                <p class="text text-white me-4">
                Founded with a love for the intricate patterns and timeless techniques of Nordic knitting, Knit&Co was
                born out of a desire to keep these traditions alive and thriving. My personal journey with knitting
                began at the age of five, when I was taught by my grandmother. Those early years were filled with the
                warmth and love of learning to knit with her, creating a foundation that I cherish to this day.

                The legacy of knitting in my life continued when I inherited yarns, needles, and hooks from my husband's
                grandmother upon her passing. These treasured items, along with the yarn supply from my sister-in-law's
                grandmother, have become integral parts of my knitting practice. Each stitch I make carries forward the
                traditions and memories of these remarkable women, and it is this spirit of heritage and continuity that
                I bring to Knit&Co.</p>
