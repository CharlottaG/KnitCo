 ## Acknowledgments
I want to extend a huge to Luke Buchanan, my mentor at Code Institute. His structured approach to our discussions, extensive coding knowledge, and ability to help me focus on the right aspects have been invaluable. His guidance in troubleshooting and thinking critically to overcome obstacles, coupled with his positive attitude, has always left me confident that I will reach my goals.
